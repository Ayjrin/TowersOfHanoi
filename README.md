# TowersOfHanoi


Assignment: Write a program that makes 3 stacks, have the program start with 2 stacks empty, the other with 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 
with 1 at the top. Have the program select a source stack to move the top item, and a destination stack to move that item to. 
The user is only allowed to push a value onto a stack if that value is less than the top of that stack.


Notes: I used to play this puzzle and many like it as a kid. I thought I was incredible at it until I heard there was a best solution. 
kinda crushed my little heart that I was actually really bad at it. The math behind the towers oh hanoi is what is really interesting to me now, 
and after sitting here thinking about it, I think it would be pretty simple to build a program to solve the towers of hanoi using recursion. 
its basically the same problem of moving all the rings off the biggest ring, moving the biggest ring, and then there is a new biggest ring, 
but that's a little much for right now.
